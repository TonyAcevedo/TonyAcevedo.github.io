<i>What physical impediments can interfere with my Wireless network?</i><p>

Here are is a short list on common causes of interference:<br>

<li>WINDOW IN BRICK WALL 2dB
<li>METAL FRAME, GLASS WALL INTO BUILDING 6dB
<li>OFFICE WALL 6dB
<li>METAL DOOR IN OFFICE WALL 6dB
<li>CINDER WALL 4dB
<li>METAL DOOR IN BRICK WALL 12.4dB
<li>BRICK WALL NEXT TO METAL DOOR 3dB<p>

It is suggested that you place your Access Point as high as possible. If
your network goes through multiple floors, try to place the Access Point
on the upper floor. If you want to connect while you're outside, place the
AP near a window. Keep it away from large metal objects such as filing
cabinets. Also, try to keep the AP's away from operating microwave ovens and
2.4GHz cordless phones. In addition, if you use 2.4 GHz phones and experience
interference, try using a different channel on the phone. <p>


<i>I have a 2.4 GHz wireless phone, will it interfere with my 802.11b wireless system?</i><p>

2.4 GHz wireless phones can cause interference, with your wireless
network. Normally symptoms will be sudden loss of wireless connectivity when
the phone is in use, or drastically reduced speeds. If any of these things
occur then you can try changing the channel on your phone. If your
phone is unable to change channels, then you can do one of the following:<p>

A) Hang up the phone and pick it up again. This will usually force the
phone to use a different channel.<p>

B) Change the channel on the Access Point and/or Router. This is not
recommended because most phones switch channels when you end a call
and start a new one. If you choose to implement this option though, most
hardware manufucturers advise that you use channel 1, 6 or 11.<p>

<i>How should Throughput be measured with an 802.11b product?</i><p>

Any card supporting the 802.11b standard supports the nominal 11Mbps
"burst" data rate - occasionally coming close to 6Mbps for good links.
Time duplexing, which involves the allocation of the direction of
transmission, does not necessarily cut the rate in half because
traffic can be asymmetric (especially for applications like streaming video).
There is overhead for header information at the physical link, IP layers for
every data packet and there are also transmitted packets that maintain the
network but do not contain application data (the video in this case).
Enabling Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) may also cause a slight
degradation in throughput.<p>

If your packet error rate is high (over 10%), you are probably
experiencing interference. A signal strength indicator may report the signal
as "good" with interference. Signal quality may even acceptable, since
interference may be intermittent. It is possible for interference to be so bad
that you don't see high packet error rates because you don't even recognize
incoming packets - this can be verified by comparing the number of packets
sent by the AP to the number of packets received by wireless client.<p>

<i>What frequencies are used to operate Instant Wireless equipment?</i><p>

Instant Wireless equipment uses DSSS [Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum]
technology. In North America, 11 channels are available.
The breakdown of the frequencies is as follows:<p>

<li>Channel 1 2.412GHz
<li>Channel 2 2.417GHz
<li>Channel 3 2.422GHz
<li>Channel 4 2.427GHz
<li>Channel 5 2.432GHz
<li>Channel 6 2.437GHz
<li>Channel 7 2.442GHz
<li>Channel 8 2.447GHz
<li>Channel 9 2.452GHz
<li>Channel 10 2.457GHz
<li>Channel 11 2.462GHz
